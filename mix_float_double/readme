Mixing float and double
=======================

Mixing floats with doubles forces implicit casting which is slow on 64-bit system.

Method 1(single-double): single precision float with constant double precision float, a + 1.001
Method 2(single-single): single precision float with constant single precision float, a + 1.001
Method 3(double-double): double precision float with constant double precision float, a + 1.001
